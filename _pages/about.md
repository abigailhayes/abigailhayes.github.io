I am a first year PhD student at the [Chair of Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/) in the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/), supervised by [Professor Markus Strohmaier](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/team/prof-dr-markus-strohmaier/). I am still developing my personal research interests but have begun by looking at link prediction in social networks.

In 2024, I completed the Mannheim Master in Data Science. My Master thesis explored whether reinforcement learning delivers comparable performance to traditional algorithms for the Vehicle Routing Problem.
